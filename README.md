Edge and Cloud Computing with Light-Weight Machine Learning Based IoT

This project demonstrates an IoT application that logs system resource usage, integrates with a SQL Server database, uses AES encryption, trains an optimized decision tree model for anomaly detection, and visualizes sensor data trends.

Features:
- Database Integration: Connects to a SQL Server using pyodbc.
- Secure Encryption: Uses AES encryption to secure data.
- Machine Learning: Optimized decision tree model with hyperparameter tuning.
- Data Simulation: Generates synthetic sensor data and applies differential privacy.
- Visualization: Plots trends for temperature and humidity.
- Continuous Integration: GitHub Actions runs tests automatically on push.
